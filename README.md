# Auth0 + Netlify SPA Example

This project demonstrates how to use **Auth0** authentication in a static Single-Page Application (SPA) hosted on **Netlify**, with **Netlify Functions** acting as a secure backend for calling the Auth0 Management API.

---

## ðŸš€ How it works

1. **SPA Login (index.html)**  
   - The frontend uses the [Auth0 SPA JS SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spa-js).  
   - On page load, the app redirects users to Auth0 Universal Login.  
   - After login, Auth0 redirects back to the app with a code, which is exchanged for tokens.  

2. **Management API via Netlify Functions**  
   - Frontend calls Netlify Functions (`/api/mgmt-user`) to securely fetch user profile info.  
   - The function uses **Machine-to-Machine (M2M)** credentials stored as environment variables in Netlify.  
   - No secrets are ever exposed in the frontend.

3. **Environment Variables (set in Netlify Dashboard â†’ Site settings â†’ Environment variables)**

AUTH0_DOMAIN=dev-ppsnetwf.us.auth0.com
AUTH0_M2M_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
AUTH0_M2M_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

## ðŸ›  Development

### Run locally
You can test functions locally with [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/):

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify dev

This will serve the frontend and functions on http://localhost:8888.

Deploy

Push to GitHub â†’ Netlify will auto-deploy.
Or manually:

netlify deploy --prod


â¸»

ðŸ”‘ Auth0 Setup
	1.	Create an SPA application in Auth0
	â€¢	Allowed Callback URLs â†’ http://localhost:8888/, https://YOUR-SITE.netlify.app/
	â€¢	Allowed Logout URLs â†’ http://localhost:8888/, https://YOUR-SITE.netlify.app/
	2.	Create a Machine-to-Machine application in Auth0
	â€¢	Authorize it for the Management API.
	â€¢	Add read:users scope.
	â€¢	Copy its Client ID and Client Secret into Netlify environment variables.

â¸»

âœ… Functions

mgmt-selftest.js
	â€¢	Verifies:
	â€¢	Env vars are set
	â€¢	M2M token works
	â€¢	Management API responds

mgmt-user.js
	â€¢	Returns profile data for the logged-in user
	â€¢	Calls Auth0 Management API securely with M2M token

â¸»

ðŸ§ª Test the setup
	â€¢	Visit your deployed site â†’ you should be redirected to Auth0 login
	â€¢	Log in â†’ redirected back â†’ profile shown
	â€¢	Open browser console â†’ check /api/mgmt-user call returns JSON
